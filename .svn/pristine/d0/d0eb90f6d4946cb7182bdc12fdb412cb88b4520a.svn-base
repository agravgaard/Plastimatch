3D Slicer plugin
================

Plastimatch is available as an Extension (plug-in) for 3D Slicer.  
This is one of the easiest methods for using plastimatch, 
because it does not require using the complicated command line interface.  
Furthermore, all of the 3D Slicer Extensions are pre-compiled, and 
(in theory) easy to download and use.  

With Slicer 4, the plastimatch extension is delivered together with the 
SlicerRT extension.  Please see the SlicerRT web page for installation 
instructions.
