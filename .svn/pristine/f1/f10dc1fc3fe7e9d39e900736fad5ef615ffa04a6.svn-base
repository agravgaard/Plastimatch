Programming APIs
================

Plastimatch has historically been designed as an application, and 
has only limited availability for use as an API.  However, we are trying 
to improve this situation.  The following is a work in progress toward 
making a usable API.

There is partial documentation available through plastimatch doxygen.
At this time, the API is not yet stable, so use at your own risk.
