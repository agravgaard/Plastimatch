This directory includes a bash completion script for use with platimatch.

Using the included script will allow Linux users using the bash command shell
to use the <TAB> key to auto complete plastimatch commands as well as find
valid input files for various plastimatch operations.

To enable command auto-completion in bash:
  1) Copy the included script (named 'plastimatch') into
     your bash completion configuration directory:

     $ sudo cp plastimatch /etc/bash_completion.d/

  2) Refresh the auto completion system by running:

     $ . /etc/bash_completion

     -OR-

     alternatively, you may simply reboot

  3) Enjoy!
