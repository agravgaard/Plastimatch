``plastimatch command [options]``

Description
-----------
The plastimatch executable is used for 
a variety of operations on either 2D or 3D images, including image
registration, warping, resampling, and file format conversion. 
The form of the options depends upon the command given.

.. _plastimatch_add:

plastimatch add
---------------
The *add* command is used to add one or more images together and create 
an output image.  The contributions of the input images can be weighted
with a weight vector.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch add [options] input_file [input_file ...]
 Options:
   --average        produce an output file which is the average of the 
                     input files (if no weights are specified), or 
                     multiply the weights by 1/n 
   --output <arg>   output image 
   --weight <arg>   specify a vector of weights; the images are 
                     multiplied by the weight prior to adding their 
                     values 

Examples
^^^^^^^^
To add together files 01.mha, 02.mha and 03.mha, and save the result 
in the file output.mha, you can run the following command::

  plastimatch add --output output.mha 01.mha 02.mha 03.mha

If you wanted output.mha to be 2 * 01.mha + 0.5 * 02.mha + 0.1 * 03.mha, 
then you should do this::

  plastimatch add \
    --output output.mha \
    --weight "2 0.5 0.1" \
    01.mha 02.mha 03.mha


plastimatch adjust
------------------
The *adjust* command is used to adjust the intensity values 
within an image.  The adjustment operations available are truncation and 
linear scaling.  

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch adjust [options]
  Required:
    --input <arg>       input directory or filename 
    --output <arg>      output image 
  Optional:
    --pw-linear <arg>   a string that forms a piecewise linear 
                         map from input values to output values, 
                         of the form "in1,out1,in2,out2,..." 

The adjust command can be used to make a piecewise 
linear adjustment of
the image intensities.  The --pw-linear option is used to create 
the mapping from input intensities to output intensities.  
The input intensities in the curve must increase from left to right 
in the string, but output intensities are arbitrary.  

Input intensities below the first pair or after the last pair 
are transformed by extrapolating the curve out to infinity with 
a slope of +1.  A different slope may be specified out to 
positive or negative infinity by specifying the special 
input values of -inf and +inf.  In this case, the 
second number in the pair is the slope of the curve, not the 
output intensity.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
The following command will add 100 to all voxels in the image::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --pw-linear "0,100"

The following command does the same thing, but with explicit 
specification of the slope in the extrapolation area::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --pw-linear "-inf,1,0,100,inf,1"

The following command truncates the inputs to the 
range of [-1000,+1000]::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --pw-linear "-inf,0,-1000,-1000,+1000,+1000,inf,0"

plastimatch average
-------------------
The *average* command is used to compute the (weighted) average 
of multiple input images.  It is the same as the plastimatch *add* 
command, with the --average option specified.  
Please refer to :ref:`plastimatch_add` for the list of command line 
arguments.

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command will compute the average of three input images::

  plastimatch average \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    01.mha 02.mha 0.3.mha

plastimatch autolabel
---------------------
The *autolabel* command is an experimental program the uses machine 
learning to identify the thoracic vertibrae in a CT scan.  

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch autolabel [options]
  Options:
    -h, --help            Display this help message 
        --input <arg>     Input image filename (required) 
        --network <arg>   Input trained network filename (required) 
        --output <arg>    Output csv filename (required) 

plastimatch boundary
--------------------
The *boundary* command takes a binary label image as input, and
generates an image of the image boundary as the output.
The boundary is defined as the voxels within the label
which have neighboring voxels outside the label.

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch boundary [options] input_file
  Required:
    --output <arg>   filename for output image 


plastimatch crop
----------------
The *crop* command crops out a rectangular portion of the input file, 
and saves that portion to an output file.
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch crop [options]
  Required:
      --input=image_in
      --output=image_out
      --voxels="x-min x-max y-min y-max z-min z-max" (integers)

The voxels are indexed starting at zero.
In other words, if the size of the image is 
:math:`M \times N \times P`,
the x values should range between 0 and :math:`M-1`.

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command selects the region of size 
:math:`10 \times 10 \times 10`, with the first voxel of the output 
image being at location (5,8,12) of the input image::

  plastimatch crop \
    --input in.mha \
    --output out.mha \
    --voxels "5 14 8 17 12 21"

plastimatch compare
-------------------
The *compare* command compares two files by subtracting 
one file from the other, and reporting statistics 
of the difference image.
The two input files must have the 
same geometry (origin, dimensions, and voxel spacing).
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch compare image_in_1 image_in_2

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command subtracts synth_2 from synth_1, and 
reports the statistics::

  $ plastimatch compare synth_1.mha synth_2.mha 
  MIN -558.201904 AVE 7.769664 MAX 558.680847
  MAE 85.100204 MSE 18945.892578
  DIF 54872 NUM 54872

The reported statistics are interpreted as follows::

  MIN      Minimum value of difference image
  AVE      Average value of difference image
  MAX      Maximum value of difference image
  MAE      Mean average value of difference image
  MSE      Mean squared difference between images
  DIF      Number of pixels with different intensities
  NUM      Total number of voxels in the difference image

plastimatch compose
-------------------
The *compose* command is used to compose two transforms.  
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch compose file_1 file_2 outfile

  Note:  file_1 is applied first, and then file_2.
            outfile = file_2 o file_1
            x -> x + file_2(x + file_1(x))

The transforms can be of any type, including translation, rigid, affine, 
itk B-spline, native B-spline, or vector fields.  
The output file is always a vector field.  

There is a further restriction that at least one of the input files 
must be either a native B-spline or vector field.  This restriction 
is required because that is how the resolution and voxel spacing 
of the output vector field is chosen.

Example
^^^^^^^
Suppose we want to compose a rigid transform (rigid.tfm) with a vector field
(vf.mha), such that the output transform is equivalent to applying 
the rigid transform first, and the vector field second.
::

  plastimatch compose rigid.tfm vf.mha composed_vf.mha

.. _plastimatch_convert:

plastimatch convert
-------------------
The *convert* command is used to convert files from one 
format to another format.  As part of the conversion process, it can 
also apply (linear or deformable) geometric transforms 
to the input images.  In fact, *convert* is just an alias for the 
*warp* command.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch convert [options]

Examples
^^^^^^^^
The first example demonstrates how to convert 
a DICOM volume to NRRD.  The DICOM images 
that comprise the volume must be 
stored in a single directory, which for this example 
is called "dicom-in-dir".  Because the --output-type option was 
not specified, 
the output type will be matched to the type of the input DICOM volume. 
The format of the output file (NRRD) is determined from the filename 
extension. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input dicom-in-dir \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd

This example further converts the type of the image intensities to float. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input dicom-in-dir \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd \
    --output-type float

The next example shows how to resample the output image to a different 
geometry.  The --origin option sets the position of the 
(center of) the first voxel of the image, the --dim option sets the 
number of voxels, and the --spacing option sets the 
distance between voxels.  The units for origin and spacing are 
assumed to be millimeters. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input dicom-in-dir \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd \
    --origin "-200 -200 -165" \
    --dim "250 250 110" \
    --spacing "2 2 2.5"

Generally speaking, it is tedious to manually specify the geometry of 
the output file.  If you want to match the geometry of the output 
file with an existing file, you can do this using the --fixed option. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input dicom-in-dir \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd \
    --fixed reference.nrrd

This next example shows how to convert a DICOM RT structure set file 
into an image using the --output-ss-img option.  
Because structures in DICOM RT are polylines, they are rasterized to 
create the image.  The voxels of the output image are 32-bit integers, 
where the i^th bit of each integer has value one if the voxel lies with 
in the corresponding structure, and value zero if the voxel lies outside the
structure.  The structure names are stored in separate file using 
the --output-ss-list option. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input structures.dcm \
    --output-ss-img outfile.nrrd \
    --output-ss-list outfile.txt

In the previous example, the geometry of the output file wasn't specified.
When the geometry of a DICOM RT structure set isn't specified, it is 
assumed to match the geometry of the DICOM CT image associated with the 
contours.  If the associated DICOM CT image is in the same directory as 
the structure set file, it will be found automatically.  Otherwise, we 
have to tell plastimatch where it is located with the --dicom-dir option. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input structures.dcm \
    --output-ss-img outfile.nrrd \
    --output-ss-list outfile.txt \
    --dicom-dir ../ct-directory


plastimatch dice
----------------
The plastimatch *dice* compares binary label images using Dice coefficient, 
Hausdorff distance, or contour mean distance.  The input images are 
treated as boolean, where non-zero values mean that voxel is inside 
of the structure and zero values mean that the voxel is outside 
of the structure.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch dice [options] reference-image test-image
 Options:
  --all            Compute Dice, Hausdorff, and contour mean 
                    distance (equivalent to --dice --hausdorff 
                    --contour-mean) 
  --contour-mean   Compute contour mean distance 
  --dice           Compute Dice coefficient (default) 
  --hausdorff      Compute Hausdorff distance and average Hausdorff 
                    distance 

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command computes all three statistics for mask1.mha 
and mask2.mha::

  plastimatch dice --all mask1.mha mask2.mha


plastimatch diff
----------------
The plastimatch *diff* command subtracts one image from another, and saves 
the output as a new image.
The two input files must have the 
same geometry (origin, dimensions, and voxel spacing).

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch diff image_in_1 image_in_2 image_out

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command computes file1.nrrd minus file2.nrrd, and saves 
the result in outfile.nrrd::

  plastimatch diff file1.nrrd file2.nrrd outfile.nrrd


plastimatch dmap
----------------
The plastimatch *dmap* command takes a binary label image as input, 
and creates a distance map image as the output.  
The output image has the 
same image geometry (origin, dimensions, voxel spacing) as the
input image.

The command line usage is given as follows::


 Usage: plastimatch dmap [options]
 Required:
  --input <arg>        input directory or filename 
  --output <arg>       output image 
 Optional:
  --algorithm <arg>    a string that specifies the algorithm used 
                        for distance map calculation, either 
                        "maurer", "danielsson", or "itk-danielsson" 
                        (default is "danielsson") 
  --inside-positive    voxels inside the structure should be 
                        positive (by default they are negative) 
  --maximum-distance <arg>   
                       voxels with distances greater than this 
                        number will have the distance truncated to 
                        this number 
  --squared-distance   return the squared distance instead of 
                        distance 


Example
^^^^^^^
The following command computes a distance map file dmap.nrrd 
from a binary labelmap image label.nrrd.::

  plastimatch dmap --input label.nrrd --output dmap.nrrd

  
plastimatch drr
---------------
This command is under construction.


plastimatch dvh
---------------
The *dvh* command creates a dose value histogram (DVH) 
from a given dose image and structure set image.  
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch dvh [options]
     --input-ss-img file
     --input-ss-list file
     --input-dose file
     --output-csv file
     --input-units {gy,cgy}
     --cumulative
     --num-bins
     --bin-width

The required inputs are 
--input-dose, 
--input-ss-img, --input-ss-list, 
and --output-csv.
The units of the input dose must be either Gy or cGy.  
DVH bin values will be generated for all structures found in the 
structure set files.  The output will be generated as an ASCII 
csv-format spreadsheet file, readable by OpenOffice.org or Microsoft Excel.

The default is a differential (standard) histogram, rather than the 
cumulative DVH which is most common in radiotherapy.  To create a cumulative 
DVH, use the --cumulative option.  

The default is to create 256 bins, each with a width of 1 Gy.  
You can adjust these values using the --num-bins and --bin-width option.

Example
^^^^^^^
To generate a DVH for a single 2 Gy fraction, we might choose 250 bins each of 
width 1 cGy.  If the input dose is already specified in cGy, you would 
use the following command::

  plastimatch dvh \
    --input-ss-img structures.mha \
    --input-ss-list structures.txt \
    --input-dose dose.mha \
    --output-csv dvh.csv \
    --input-units cgy \
    --num-bins 250 \
    --bin-width 1


plastimatch fill
----------------
The *fill* command is used to fill an image region with a constant 
intensity.  The region filled is defined by a mask file, 
with voxels with non-zero intensity in the mask image being filled.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch fill [options]
 Options:
   --input <arg>         input directory or filename; can be an image 
                          or dicom directory 
   --mask <arg>          input filename for mask image 
   --mask-value <arg>    value to set for pixels within mask (for 
                          "fill"), or outside of mask (for "mask" 
   --output <arg>        output filename (for image file) or directory 
                          (for dicom) 
   --output-format <arg> arg should be "dicom" for dicom output 
   --output-type <arg>   type of output image, one of {uchar, short, 
                          float, ...} 

Examples
^^^^^^^^
Suppose we have a file prostate.nrrd which is zero outside of the 
prostate, and non-zero inside of the prostate.  
We can fill the prostate with an intensity of 1000, while 
leaving non-prostate areas with their original intensity, using 
the following command. ::

  plastimatch fill \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --mask-value 1000 \
    --mask prostate.nrrd


plastimatch filter
------------------
The *filter* command applies a filter to an input image,
and creates a filtered image as its output.
The filter can be either built-in, or custom.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch filter [options] input_image
 Options:
  --gabor-k-fib <arg>     choose gabor direction at index i within 
                           fibonacci spiral of length n; specified as
                           "i n" where i and n are integers, and i is
                           between 0 and n-1 
  --gauss-width <arg>     the width (in mm) of a uniform Gaussian 
                           smoothing filter 
  --kernel <arg>          kernel image filename 
  --output <arg>          output image filename 
  --output-kernel <arg>   output kernel filename 
  --pattern <arg>         filter type: {gabor, gauss, kernel}, 
                           default is gauss 

The built-in filters supported are "gabor" and "gauss".  
For a Gaussian, the width of the Gaussian can be controlled
using the --gauss-width option.
The Gabor filter is currently limited to automatic selection of
filter directions, which are spaced quasi-uniformly on the 
unit sphere.
Custom filters are specified by supplying a kernel file,
which is convolved with the image.

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command will generate a filtered image from the
first gabor filter within a bank of 10 filters.::

  plastimatch filter --pattern gabor Testing/rect-1.mha \
    --gabor-k-fib "0 5" --output g-05.mha

plastimatch gamma
-----------------
The *gamma* command compares two images using the so-called
gamma criterion.  The gamma criterion specifies that
images are similar at a givel location within a reference
image if there exists a voxel with similar intensity
nearby in the comparison image.
Both local gamma and global gamma can be performed
using this command.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch gamma [options] image_1 image_2
 Options:
  --analysis-threshold <arg>   
      Analysis threshold for dose in float (for
       example, input 0.1 to apply 10% of the 
       reference dose). The final threshold dose
       (Gy) is calculated by multiplying this 
       value and a given reference dose (or 
       maximum dose if not given). (default is 
       0.1) 
  --compute-full-region    With this option, full gamma map will be 
       generated over the entire image region 
       (even for low-dose region). It is 
       recommended not to use this option to 
       speed up the computation. It has no 
       effect on gamma pass-rate. 
  --dose-tolerance <arg>   The scaling coefficient for dose 
       difference. (e.g. put 0.02 if you want to
       apply 2% dose difference criterion) 
       (default is 0.03) 
  --dta-tolerance <arg>    The distance-to-agreement (DTA) scaling 
       coefficient in mm (default is 3) 
  --gamma-max <arg>        The maximum value of gamma to compute; 
       smaller values run faster (default is 
       2.0) 
  --inherent-resample <arg>   
      Spacing value in [mm]. The reference 
       image itself will be resampled by this 
       value (Note: resampling compare-image to 
       ref-image is inherent already). If arg < 
       0, this option is disabled. (default is 
       -1.0) 
  --interp-search          With this option, smart interpolation 
       search will be used in points near the 
       reference point. This will eliminate the 
       needs of fine resampling. However, it 
       will take longer time to compute. 
  --local-gamma            With this option, dose difference is 
       calculated based on local dose 
       difference. Otherwise, a given reference 
       dose will be used, which is called 
       global-gamma. 
  --output <arg>           Output image 
  --output-failmap <arg>   File path for binary gamma evaluation 
       result. 
  --output-text <arg>      Text file path for gamma evaluation 
       result. 
  --reference-dose <arg>   The prescription dose (Gy) used to 
       compute dose tolerance; if not specified,
       then maximum dose in reference volume is 
       used 
  --resample-nn            With this option, Nearest Neighbor will 
       be used instead of linear interpolation 
       in resampling the compare-image to the 
       reference image. Not recommended for 
       better results. 


Example
^^^^^^^
A gamma image is produced from two input images using the default
parameters.  This will be a global gamma, using maximum intensity
of the reference image as the gamma normalization value.::

 plastimatch gamma --output gamma.mha \
   reference-image.mha compare-image.mha


plastimatch header
------------------
The *header* command is used to display simple properties about 
the volume, such as the image data type and image geometry.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch header [options] input_file [input_file ...]
 Options:
  -h, --help      display this help message 
      --version   display the program version 

Example
^^^^^^^
We can display the geometry of any supported file type,
such as mha, nrrd, 
or dicom.  We can run the command as follows::

  $ plastimatch header input.mha
  Type = float
  Planes = 1
  Origin = -180 -180 -167.75
  Size = 512 512 120
  Spacing = 0.7031 0.7031 2.5
  Direction = 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

From the header information, we see that the image has 120 slices, 
and each slice is 512 x 512 pixels.  The slice spacing is 2.5 mm, 
and the in-plane pixel spacing is 0.7031 mm.


plastimatch jacobian
--------------------
The *jacobian* command computes the Jacobian determinant
of a vector field.  Either a Jacobian determinant image,
or its summary statistics, can be computed.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch jacobian [options]
 Options:
   --input <arg>          input directory or filename of image 
   --output-img <arg>     output image; can be mha, mhd, nii, nrrd, 
                           or other format supported by ITK 
   --output-stats <arg>   output stats file; .txt format 

Example
^^^^^^^
To create a Jacobian determinant image from a vector field
file vf.mha, run the following::

  plastimatch jacobian \
    --input vf.mha --output-img vf_jac.mha


plastimatch mabs
----------------
The *mabs* command performs a multi-atlas based segmentation (MABS) 
operation.  The command can operate in one of several
training mode, or in segmentation mode.  

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch mabs [options] command_file
 Options:
   --atlas-selection         run just atlas selection 
   --convert                 pre-process atlas 
   --output <arg>            output (non-dicom) directory when doing 
                              a segmentation 
   --output-dicom <arg>      output dicom directory when doing a 
                              segmentation 
   --pre-align               pre-process atlas 
   --segment <arg>           use mabs to segment the specified image 
                              or directory 
   --train                   perform full training to find the best 
                              registration and segmentation parameters 
   --train-atlas-selection   run just train atlas selection 
   --train-registration      perform limited training to find the 
                              best registration parameters only 

Prior to running the mabs command, you must create a configuration 
file, and you must arrange your training data into the proper
directory format.  
For a complete description of the command file syntax and
usage examples, please refer to the :ref:`mabs_guidebook`
and the :ref:`segmentation_command_file_reference`.

plastimatch mask
----------------
The *mask* command is used to fill an image region with a constant 
intensity.  The region filled is defined by a mask file, 
with voxels with zero intensity in the mask image being filled.
Thus, it is the inverse of the *fill* command.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch mask [options]
 Options:
   --input <arg>           input directory or filename; can be an 
                            image or dicom directory 
   --mask <arg>            input filename for mask image 
   --mask-value <arg>      value to set for pixels within mask (for 
                            "fill"), or outside of mask (for "mask" 
   --output <arg>          output filename (for image file) or 
                            directory (for dicom) 
   --output-format <arg>   arg should be "dicom" for dicom output 
   --output-type <arg>     type of output image, one of {uchar, short, 
                            float, ...} 

Examples
^^^^^^^^
Suppose we have a file called patient.nrrd, 
which is zero outside of the patient, and 
non-zero inside the patient.
If we want to fill in the area 
outside of the patient with value -1000, we use the following command. ::

  plastimatch mask \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --negate-mask \
    --mask-value -1000 \
    --mask patient.nrrd


plastimatch ml-convert
----------------------
To be written.


plastimatch probe
-----------------
The plastimatch *probe* command is used to examine the image intensity 
or vector field displacement at one or more positions within a volume.
The probe positions can be specified in world coordinates (in mm), using 
the --location option, or as image indices using the --index option.
The locations or indices are linearly interpolated if they lie between 
voxels.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch probe [options] file
 Options:
  -i, --index <arg>      List of voxel indices, such as 
                          "i j k;i j k;..." 
  -l, --location <arg>   List of spatial locations, such as 
                          "i j k;i j k;..." 

The command will output one line for each probe requested.  
Each output line includes the following fields.::

  PROBE#        The probe number, starting with zero
  INDEX         The (fractional) position of the probe as a voxel index
  LOC           The position of the probe in world coordinates
  VALUE         The intensity (for volumes) or displacement 
                 (for vector fields)

Example
^^^^^^^
We use the index option to see an image intensity at coordinate (2,3,4), 
and the location option to see image intensities at two different 
locations::

  plastimatch probe \
     --index "2 3 4" \
     --location "0 0 0; 0.5 0.5 0.5" \
     infile.nrrd

The output will include three probe results.  Each probe shows the 
probe index, voxel index, voxel location, and intensity. ::

  0:    2.00,    3.00,    4.00;  -22.37,  -21.05,  -19.74; -998.725891
  1:   19.00,   19.00,   19.00;    0.00,    0.00,    0.00; -0.000197
  2:   19.38,   19.38,   19.38;    0.50,    0.50,    0.50; -9.793450

plastimatch register
--------------------
The plastimatch *register* command is used to peform linear or deformable 
registration of two images.  
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch register command_file

The command file is an ordinary text file, which contains a single 
global section and one or more stages sections. 
The global section begins with a line containing only the string "[GLOBAL]", 
and each stage begins with a line containing the string "[STAGE]".  

The global section is used to set input files, output files, and 
global parameters, while the each stage section defines a sequential 
stage of processing.  For a complete description of the command file 
syntax, please refer to the :ref:`registration_command_file_reference`.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. include:: image_registration_quick_start.rst

For more examples, please refer to the :ref:`image_registration_guidebook`.

plastimatch resample
--------------------
The *resample* command can be used to change the geometry of an image.

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch resample [options]
  Required:   --input=file
              --output=file
  Optional:   --subsample="x y z"
              --fixed=file
              --origin="x y z"
              --spacing="x y z"
              --size="x y z"
              --output_type={uchar,short,ushort,float,vf}
              --interpolation={nn, linear}
              --default_val=val

Example
^^^^^^^
We can use the --subsample option to bin an integer number of voxels 
to a single voxel.  So for example, if we want to bin a cube of size 
3x3x1 voxels to a single voxel, we would do the following. ::

  plastimatch resample \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --subsample "3 3 1"

plastimatch scale
-----------------
The *scale* command scales an image or vector field by multiplying 
each voxel by a constant value.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch scale [options] input_file
 Options:
   --output <arg>   filename for output image or vector field 
   --weight <arg>   scale the input image or vector field by this 
                     value (float) 

Example
^^^^^^^
This command creates an output file with image intensity (or voxel 
length) twice as large as the input values::

 plastimatch scale --output output.mha --weight 2.0 input.mha


plastimatch segment
-------------------
The *segment* command does simple threshold-based semgentation.  
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch segment [options]
  Options:
    -h, --help                    Display this help message 
        --input <arg>             Input image filename (required) 
        --lower-threshold <arg>   Lower threshold (include voxels 
                                   above this value) 
        --output-dicom <arg>      Output dicom directory (for RTSTRUCT) 
        --output-img <arg>        Output image filename 
        --upper-threshold <arg>   Upper threshold (include voxels 
                                   below this value) 

Example
^^^^^^^
Suppose we have a CT image of a water tank, and we wish to create an image 
which has ones where there is water, and zeros where there is air.  
Then we could do this::

  plastimatch segment \
    --input water.mha \
    --output-img water-label.mha \
    --lower-threshold -500

If we wanted instead to create a DICOM-RT structure set, we should 
specify a DICOM image as the input.  This will allow plastimatch to 
create the DICOM-RT with the correct patient name, patient id, and UIDs.
The output file will be called "ss.dcm".
::

  plastimatch segment \
    --input water_dicom \
    --output-dicom water_dicom \
    --lower-threshold -500


plastimatch stats
-----------------
The plastimatch stats command displays a few basic statistics about the 
image onto the screen.

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch stats file [file ...]

The input files can be either 2D projection images, 3D volumes, or 
3D vector fields.

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command displays statistics for the 3D volume synth_1.mha. ::

  $ plastimatch stats synth_1.mha
  MIN -999.915161 AVE -878.686035 MAX 0.000000 NUM 54872

The reported statistics are interpreted as follows::

  MIN      Minimum intensity in image
  AVE      Average intensity in image
  MAX      Maximum intensity in image
  NUM      Number of voxels in image

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command displays statistics for the 3D vector field vf.mha::

  $ plastimatch stats vf.mha
  Min:            0.000     -0.119     -0.119
  Mean:          13.200      0.593      0.593
  Max:           21.250      1.488      1.488
  Mean abs:      13.200      0.594      0.594
  Energy: MINDIL -6.79 MAXDIL 0.166 MAXSTRAIN 41.576 TOTSTRAIN 70849
  Min dilation at: (29 19 19)
  Jacobian: MINJAC -6.32835 MAXJAC 1.15443 MINABSJAC 0.360538
  Min abs jacobian at: (28 36 36)
  Second derivatives: MINSECDER 0 MAXSECDER 388.82 TOTSECDER 669219 
    INTSECDER 1.524e+06
  Max second derivative: (29 36 36)

The rows corresponding to "Min, Mean, Max, and Mean abs" each 
have three numbers, which correspond to the x, y, and z coordinates.  
Therefore, they compute these statistics for each vector direction 
separately.

The remaining statistics are described as follows::

  MINDIL        Minimum dilation
  MAXDIL        Maximum dilation
  MAXSTRAIN     Maximum strain
  TOTSTRAIN     Total strain
  MINJAC        Minimum Jacobian     
  MAXJAC        Maximum Jacobian
  MINABSJAC     Minimum absolute Jacobian
  MINSECDER     Minimum second derivative
  MAXSECDER     Maximum second derivative
  TOTSECDER     Total second derivative
  INTSECDER     Integral second derivative


plastimatch synth
-----------------
The *synth* command creates a synthetic image.  The following kinds 
of images can be created, by specifying the appropriate --pattern option.
Each of these patterns come with a synthetic structure set and 
synthetic dose which can be used for testing.

- donut -- a donut shaped structure
- gauss -- a Gaussian blur
- grid -- a 3D grid
- lung -- a synthetic lung with a tumor
- rect -- a uniform rectangle within a uniform background

input intensity image.  

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch threshold [options]
 Options:
    --above <arg>    value above which output has value high 
    --below <arg>    value below which output has value high

                      of the ranges ([r1-lo,r1-hi], [r2-lo,r2-hi], 
                      ...) have output value high 

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command creates a binary label image with
value 1 when input intensities are between 100 and 200,
and value 0 otherwise.::

 plastimatch threshold \
   --input input_image.nrrd \
   --output output_labe.nrrd \
   --range "100,200"


plastimatch thumbnail
---------------------
The *thumbnail* command generates a two-dimensional thumbnail image of an 
axial slice of the input volume.  The output image 
is not required to correspond exactly to an integer slice number.  
The location of the output image within the slice is always centered. 

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch thumbnail [options] input-file
  Options:
    --input file
    --output file
    --thumbnail-dim size
    --thumbnail-spacing size
    --slice-loc location

Example
^^^^^^^
We create a two-dimensional image with resolution 10 x 10 pixels,
at axial location 0, and of size 20 x 20 mm::

  plastimatch thumbnail \
    --input in.mha --output out.mha \
    --thumbnail-dim 10 \
    --thumbnail-spacing 2 \
    --slice-loc 0


plastimatch union
-----------------
The *union* command creates a binary volume which is the 
logical union of two input images.  Voxels in the output 
image have 
value one if the voxel is non-zero in either input image, 
or value zero if the voxel is zero in both input images.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch union [options] input_1 input_2
 Options:
  -h, --help           display this help message 
      --output <arg>   filename for output image 
      --version        display the program version 

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command creates a volume that is the 
union of two input images::

 plastimatch union \
   --output itv.mha \
   phase_1.mha phase_2.mha


plastimatch warp
----------------
The *warp* command is an alias for *convert*.  
Please refer to :ref:`plastimatch_convert` for the list
of command line parameters.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
To warp an image using the B-spline coefficients generated by the 
plastimatch register command (saved in the file bspline.txt), do the 
following::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --xf bspline.txt

In the previous example, the output file geometry was determined by the 
geometry information in the bspline coefficient file.  You can resample 
to a different geometry using --fixed, or --origin, --dim, and --spacing. ::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --xf bspline.txt \
    --fixed reference.nrrd

When warping a structure set image, where the integer bits correspond to 
structure membership, you need to use nearest neighbor interpolation 
rather than linear interpolation. ::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input structures-in.nrrd \
    --output structures-out.nrrd \
    --xf bspline.txt \
    --interpolation nn

Sometimes, voxels located outside of the geometry of the input image 
will be warped into the geometry of the output image.  By default, these 
areas are "filled in" with an intensity of zero.  You can choose a different 
value for these areas using the --default-value option. ::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --xf bspline.txt \
    --default-value -1000

In addition to images and structures, landmarks exported from 3D Slicer can
also be warped. ::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input fixed_landmarks.fcsv \
    --output-pointset warped_landmarks.fcsv \
    --xf bspline.txt

Sometimes, it may be desirable to apply a transform explicitly defined by a
vector field instead of using B-spline coefficients.  To allow this, the --xf
option also accepts vector field volumes.  For example, the previous example
would become.  ::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input fixed_landmarks.fcsv \
    --output-pointset warped_landmarks.fcsv \
    --xf vf.mha


plastimatch xf-convert
----------------------
The *xf-convert* command converts between transform types.  
A tranform can be either a B-spline transform, or a vector field. 
There are two different kinds of B-spline transform formats: 
the plastimatch native format, and the ITK format.
In addition to converting the transform type, the *xf-convert* command 
can also change the grid-spacing of B-spline transforms.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch xf-convert [options]
 Options:
   --dim <arg>            Size of output image in voxels "x [y z]" 
   --grid-spacing <arg>   B-spline grid spacing in mm "x [y z]" 
   --input <arg>          Input xform filename (required) 
   --nobulk               Omit bulk transform for itk_bspline 
   --origin <arg>         Location of first image voxel in mm "x y z" 
   --output <arg>         Output xform filename (required) 
   --output-type <arg>    Type of xform to create (required), choose 
                           from {bspline, itk_bspline, vf} 
   --spacing <arg>        Voxel spacing in mm "x [y z]" 

Example
^^^^^^^
We want to convert a B-spline transform into a vector field.  If the 
B-spline transform is in native-format, the vector field 
geometry is defined by the values found in the transform header.::

  plastimatch xf-convert \
    --input bspline.txt \
    --output vf.mha \
    --output-type vf

Likewise, if we want to convert a vector field into a set of B-spline
coefficients with a control-point spacing of 30 mm in each direction. ::

  plastimatch xf-convert \
    --input vf.mha \
    --output bspline.txt \
    --output-type bspline \
    --grid-spacing 30
