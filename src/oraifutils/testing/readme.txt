This folder simply contains a few utilities (templates) for ORAIF standard software testing
which is compatible with the CTest environment.

BasicUnitTestIncludes.hxx ... standard includes / utility-methods for quicker implementation of tests
BasicUnitTestTemplate.cxx ... a minimum template for creation of unit tests; simply copy it to the destination, rename it and trace the "TODOs"
UnitTestCMAkeLists.txt ... a minimum template for creation of CMakeLists.txt *in* a "testing"-subfolder; simply copy it to the destination, rename it and trace the "TODOs"
SourceUnitTestCMAkeLists.txt ... a minimum template for creation of CMakeLists.txt *outside* a "testing"-subfolder (in the source folder below); simply copy it to the destination, rename it and trace the "TODOs"
