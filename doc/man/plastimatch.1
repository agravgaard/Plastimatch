.SH PLASTIMATCH ADJUST
.sp
The \fIadjust\fP command is used to adjust the intensity values
within an image.  The adjustment operations available are truncation and
linear scaling.
.sp
The command line usage is given as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch adjust [options]
Required:
  \-\-input <arg>       input directory or filename
  \-\-output <arg>      output image
Optional:
  \-\-pw\-linear <arg>   a string that forms a piecewise linear
                       map from input values to output values,
                       of the form "in1,out1,in2,out2,..."
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The adjust command can be used to make a piecewise
linear adjustment of
the image intensities.  The \-\-pw\-linear option is used to create
the mapping from input intensities to output intensities.
The input intensities in the curve must increase from left to right
in the string, but output intensities are arbitrary.
.sp
Input intensities below the first pair or after the last pair
are transformed by extrapolating the curve out to infinity with
a slope of +1.  A different slope may be specified out to
positive or negative infinity by specifying the special
input values of \-inf and +inf.  In this case, the
second number in the pair is the slope of the curve, not the
output intensity.

.sp
The transforms can be of any type, including translation, rigid, affine,
itk B\-spline, native B\-spline, or vector fields.
The output file is always a vector field.
.sp
There is a further restriction that at least one of the input files
must be either a native B\-spline or vector field.  This restriction
is required because that is how the resolution and voxel spacing
of the output vector field is chosen.
.SS Example
.sp
Suppose we want to compose a rigid transform (rigid.tfm) with a vector field
(vf.mha), such that the output transform is equivalent to applying
the rigid transform first, and the vector field second.

.SH PLASTIMATCH CONVERT
.sp
The \fIconvert\fP command is used to convert files from one
format to another format.  As part of the conversion process, it can
also apply (linear or deformable) geometric transforms
to the input images.  In fact, \fIconvert\fP is just an alias for the
\fIwarp\fP command.

The first example demonstrates how to convert
a DICOM volume to NRRD.  The DICOM images
that comprise the volume must be
stored in a single directory, which for this example
is called "dicom\-in\-dir".  Because the \-\-output\-type option was
not specified,
the output type will be matched to the type of the input DICOM volume.
The format of the output file (NRRD) is determined from the filename
extension.

This next example shows how to convert a DICOM RT structure set file
into an image using the \-\-output\-ss\-img option.
Because structures in DICOM RT are polylines, they are rasterized to
create the image.  The voxels of the output image are 32\-bit integers,
where the i^th bit of each integer has value one if the voxel lies with
in the corresponding structure, and value zero if the voxel lies outside the
structure.  The structure names are stored in separate file using
the \-\-output\-ss\-list option.

In the previous example, the geometry of the output file wasn\(aqt specified.
When the geometry of a DICOM RT structure set isn\(aqt specified, it is
assumed to match the geometry of the DICOM CT image associated with the
contours.  If the associated DICOM CT image is in the same directory as
the structure set file, it will be found automatically.  Otherwise, we
have to tell plastimatch where it is located with the \-\-dicom\-dir option.

Usage: plastimatch gamma [options] image_1 image_2
Options:
 \-\-analysis\-threshold <arg>
     Analysis threshold for dose in float (for
      example, input 0.1 to apply 10% of the
      reference dose). The final threshold dose
      (Gy) is calculated by multiplying this
      value and a given reference dose (or
      maximum dose if not given). (default is
      0.1)
 \-\-compute\-full\-region    With this option, full gamma map will be
      generated over the entire image region
      (even for low\-dose region). It is
      recommended not to use this option to
      speed up the computation. It has no
      effect on gamma pass\-rate.
 \-\-dose\-tolerance <arg>   The scaling coefficient for dose
      difference. (e.g. put 0.02 if you want to
      apply 2% dose difference criterion)
      (default is 0.03)
 \-\-dta\-tolerance <arg>    The distance\-to\-agreement (DTA) scaling
      coefficient in mm (default is 3)
 \-\-gamma\-max <arg>        The maximum value of gamma to compute;
      smaller values run faster (default is
      2.0)
 \-\-inherent\-resample <arg>
     Spacing value in [mm]. The reference
      image itself will be resampled by this
      value (Note: resampling compare\-image to
      ref\-image is inherent already). If arg <
      0, this option is disabled. (default is
      \-1.0)
 \-\-interp\-search          With this option, smart interpolation
      search will be used in points near the
      reference point. This will eliminate the
      needs of fine resampling. However, it
      will take longer time to compute.
 \-\-local\-gamma            With this option, dose difference is
      calculated based on local dose
      difference. Otherwise, a given reference
      dose will be used, which is called
      global\-gamma.
 \-\-output <arg>           Output image
 \-\-output\-failmap <arg>   File path for binary gamma evaluation
      result.
 \-\-output\-text <arg>      Text file path for gamma evaluation
      result.
 \-\-reference\-dose <arg>   The prescription dose (Gy) used to
      compute dose tolerance; if not specified,
      then maximum dose in reference volume is
      used
 \-\-resample\-nn            With this option, Nearest Neighbor will
      be used instead of linear interpolation
      in resampling the compare\-image to the
      reference image. Not recommended for
      better results.

.sp
The \fIwarp\fP command is an alias for \fIconvert\fP\&.
Please refer to \fI\%plastimatch convert\fP for the list
of command line parameters.
.SS Examples
.sp
To warp an image using the B\-spline coefficients generated by the
plastimatch register command (saved in the file bspline.txt), do the
following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch warp \e
  \-\-input infile.nrrd \e
  \-\-output outfile.nrrd \e
  \-\-xf bspline.txt
.ft P
.fi

.sp
In the previous example, the output file geometry was determined by the
geometry information in the bspline coefficient file.  You can resample
to a different geometry using \-\-fixed, or \-\-origin, \-\-dim, and \-\-spacing.

When warping a structure set image, where the integer bits correspond to
structure membership, you need to use nearest neighbor interpolation
rather than linear interpolation.

Sometimes, voxels located outside of the geometry of the input image
will be warped into the geometry of the output image.  By default, these
areas are "filled in" with an intensity of zero.  You can choose a different
value for these areas using the \-\-default\-value option.

In addition to images and structures, landmarks exported from 3D Slicer can
also be warped.

Sometimes, it may be desirable to apply a transform explicitly defined by a
vector field instead of using B\-spline coefficients.  To allow this, the \-\-xf
option also accepts vector field volumes.  For example, the previous example
would become.

.SH PLASTIMATCH XF-CONVERT
.sp
The \fIxf\-convert\fP command converts between transform types.
A tranform can be either a B\-spline transform, or a vector field.
There are two different kinds of B\-spline transform formats:
the plastimatch native format, and the ITK format.
In addition to converting the transform type, the \fIxf\-convert\fP command
can also change the grid\-spacing of B\-spline transforms.
.sp
The command line usage is given as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch xf\-convert [options]
Options:
  \-\-dim <arg>            Size of output image in voxels "x [y z]"
  \-\-grid\-spacing <arg>   B\-spline grid spacing in mm "x [y z]"
  \-\-input <arg>          Input xform filename (required)
  \-\-nobulk               Omit bulk transform for itk_bspline
  \-\-origin <arg>         Location of first image voxel in mm "x y z"
  \-\-output <arg>         Output xform filename (required)
  \-\-output\-type <arg>    Type of xform to create (required), choose
                          from {bspline, itk_bspline, vf}
  \-\-spacing <arg>        Voxel spacing in mm "x [y z]"

We want to convert a B\-spline transform into a vector field.  If the
B\-spline transform is in native\-format, the vector field
geometry is defined by the values found in the transform header.:
